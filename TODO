TODO
 - should rubygoo take control of the screen & events?
   - just provide callbacks?
 - make clicking on a component focus it
 - add more listener types (when mouse_enter, mouse_leave, mouse_click, focus, key_pressed...)
 - image icons for buttons

 - abstract the events that rubygoo takes and the renderer to allow for gosu-ness
 - rework color scheme to not suck
 - double-check the tab focus stuff on modal dialogs
