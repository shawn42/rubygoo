TODO
 - add enabled?/disabled?

 - KEYTOASCII in gosu adapter
 - image icons for buttons
   - create GooImage for agnostic access to image sizes, have renderer handle loading of images?
 - double-check the tab focus stuff on modal dialogs (tab focus of containers?)
   - can still tab through other widgets when modal dialog is up
 - make clicking on a component focus it
 - add key-call backs (alt-h, shift-L, ESC)
